# GIANDS constructions - A milestone project

## Introduction


This is my first milestone project and the first website I've ever designed. I decided to create a website for my husband's building  company as it made the project realistic, practical and useful. This project is a functional static-website, built mainly with HTML and CSS. In the future I'd like to revisit the project and implement other languages and technologies that will be covered in the next modules of the course. I'd also like to add a real time-snap video on a home page , (instead of a youtube video as a placeholder), and add more photos to the gallery.

## **UX-User Experience Design**

### **Strategy Plane**


The business goals for the website:

1. To inform potential clients about the business and services it provides.
2. To attract new clients who need building services by showing them examples of previous projects.
3. To provide contact details, social links and a contact form for potential clients.
4. Build a database of potential clients who can be reached in the future for offers.

User stories:

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the website.
2. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily find information regarding the business and services it provides.
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to see examples of projects undertaken by the business.
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to see reviews from previous clients.
5. As a first-time or returning visitor, I want to easily find the contact details and social links.
6. As a first-time or returning visitor, I want to access a contact form to get a quote.
7. As a first-time and returning visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website. I can access all the pages easily and go back to the home page quickly.
8. As a first-time and returning visitor, I want to be able to read the text easily and see all images clearly on different devices.

### **Scope Plane**

In order to achieve the strategy goals, the following features will be included on the website:
- The logo and the name of the company in the navbar
- Navbar, to navigate easily between the pages
- 'About us' section at the top of the Home page explaining the purpose of the business
- Caurosel with images showing previous building projects
- Time-snap video showing a project from start to finish 
- Separate 'Our Projects' page with more detailed descriptions of company's services and a gallery of completed projects
- Reviews from former clients
- Contact and social links in the footer of every page
- Separate 'Contact' page with a contact form and contact details
- Clear text and images which will be responsive on different devices

### **Structure Plane** 

The website consists of three pages:
- Home
- Our projects
- Contact
The navbar recurring on each page allows users to easily move between the pages and go back to Home Page quickly. Another reccuring element is the footer with contact details and social links. These two elements make it clear to users they are still on the same website. I used the same background colors for different sections on each page to create a certain pattern to the website. The Home Page text blocks are separated with a carousel and then followed with a video so that users are not overburden with one type of input. Similarly 'Our Projects' page is divided into a text section and a gallery of images of completed projects. The 'Contact' page contains a contact form and contact details and I felt it did not need more content to serve its purpose.
