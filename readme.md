# GIANDS constructions - A milestone project

## Introduction


This is my first milestone project and the first website I've ever designed. I decided to create a website for my husband's building  company as it made the project realistic, practical and useful. This project is a functional static-website, built mainly with HTML and CSS. In the future I'd like to revisit the project and implement other languages and technologies that will be covered in the next modules of the course. I'd also like to add a real time-snap video on a home page , (instead of a youtube video as a placeholder), and add more photos to the gallery.
